Agenda:

- Containerization
- Docker, Docker Lab
- Docker Compose -- Project VM - Project Lab

#### Phase 2 Review
Devops

Plan ---> Code and Configuration --> Build ----> Test ---> Integrate -->
		--> QA Test ---> Performance Test ---> Release --> Can deploy?(Manual approval)
				---> Deploy ----> Manage ---> Monitor


1. create a code repository/clone a code repository
	- use git
2. Edit/Add code resources, configuration resources and save them
	- use IDE (Eclipse)
	- update repository-synchronize with repository - local and github
3. Build modules/apps
	- use Build tools
	- maven | gradle
			-- build
			-- bootjar
			-- bootrun
4. Run Unit Tests
	- junit tests
	- app tests
5. Run Integration Tests
	- modules integrations
	- examples: authservice--dataservice integration
	- frondend module -- auth service module - data service module
6. Run User Acceptance Tests (UAT)
7. Run performance tests/load tests
8. Ready to deploy to production environment?
9. Deploy to prod
10. Post deployment tests

How to create a docker container for my app and run?

- docker build
- docker run
- docker status

Dockerfile instructions

https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/

FROM: The keyword FROM, tells Docker to use a given image with its tag as build-base. If this image is not in the local library, 
an online-search on DockerHub, or on any other configured remote-registry, is performed

RUN: With the RUN command, we're executing a shell command-line within the target system.
 
COPY: This command tells Docker to COPY a few files from the local file-system, specifically a subfolder to the build directory, 
into the image in a given path

ENV: This command lets us define some environment variables, which will be respected by the application running in the container

ENTRYPOINT/CMD: This will be the executable to start when the container is booting. We must define them as JSON-Array, 
because we will use an ENTRYPOINT in combination with a CMD for some application arguments

VOLUME: Because our container will be running in an isolated environment, with no direct network access, 
we have to define a mountpoint-placeholder for our configuration repository

EXPOSE: Here we are telling Docker, on which port our application is listing. 
This port will be published to the host, when the container is booting.

Project Lab: Docker Compose

1. go to project VM

2. Navigate to /labfiles/Sample code for Projects/Docker Compose Lab.pdf

3. Open this lab guide, follow instructions to do Docker Compose Lab.

# Class Notes
Legacy approach for monolithic projects:

Microservice approach:

### Docker

Using a single machine:
![[Pasted image 20230301094243.png]]

Using multiple VMs to run programs:
![[Pasted image 20230301094724.png]]
if one VM crashes, it doesn't affect the other VMs

#### What is Docker?

![[Pasted image 20230301095755.png]]

### Install Docker
![[Pasted image 20230301101432.png]]

#### Docker stacks
![[Pasted image 20230301102512.png]]
Sharing a common OS saves CPU, memory, and hard disk resources

Hybrid version:
![[Pasted image 20230301102832.png]]
- closely related containers can be grouped together to lower the amount of computer power needed to run the full operation
- you could have an auth service and data service running on one VM, a React app on another VM, and a DB service on another VM
