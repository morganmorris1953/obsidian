git push \--force

Forces the git push even if it results in a non-fast-forward merge. Do not use the \--force flag unless you're absolutely sure you know what you're doing.

 

git push \--all

Push all of your local branches to the specified remote.

 

git push \--tags

Tags aren't automatically pushed when you push a branch or use the \--all flag. The \--tags flag sends all of your local tags to the remote repo
