git revert \<commit\>

Create new commit that undoes all of the changes made in

\<commit\>, then apply it to the current branch.

 

Git reset \<file\>

Remove \<file\> from the staging area, but leave the working directory

unchanged. This unstages a file without overwriting any changes.

 

Git clean -n

Shows which files would be removed from working directory.

Use the -f flag in place of the -n flag to execute the clean.
