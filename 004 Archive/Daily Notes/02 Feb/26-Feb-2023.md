# Lab 11 - Create a Pipeline
#jenkings #pipeline
#### Part 1 - Create a Simple Pipeline
We can create a pipeline job that includes the pipeline script in the job configuration, or
the pipeline script can be put into a 'Jenkinsfile' that's checked-in to version control.
To get a taste of the pipeline, we'll start off with a very simple pipeline defined in the job
configuration.
Prerequisite: We need to have a project in source control to check-out and build. For
this example, we're using the 'SimpleGreeting' project that we previously cloned to a
'Git' repository at 'C:\Software\repos\SimpleGreeting.git'
__1. In Jenkins, go to home and then click on the New Item link.
__2. Enter SimpleGreetingPipeline as the new item name, and select Pipeline as the
item type.

![[Pasted image 20230226124336.png]]
__3. When the input looks as above, click on OK to create the new item.
89__4. Scroll down to the Pipeline section and enter the following in the Script text
window.
```
node {
stage('Checkout') {
git url: 'C:\\Software\\repos\\SimpleGreeting.git'
}
}
stage('Gradle build') {
bat 'gradle build'
}
```
This pipeline is divided into two stages. First, we checkout the project from our 'git' repository. Then we use the 'bat' command to run 'gradle build' as a Windows batch file.
All of the above is wrapped inside the 'node' command, to indicate that we want to run these commands in the context of a workspace running on one of Jenkins execution agents (or the master node if no agents are available).
__5. Click on Save to save the changes and return to the project page.
__6. Click on Build Now to start up a pipeline instance.
__7. After a few moments, you should see the Stage View appear, and successive stages will appear as the build proceeds, until all stages are completed.

#### Part 2 - Pipeline Definition in a 'Jenkinsfile'
For simple pipelines or experimentation, it's convenient to define the pipeline script in the web interface. But one of the common themes of modern software development is "If it isn't in version control, it didn't happen". The pipeline definition is no different, especially as you build more and more complex pipelines.
You can define the pipeline in a special file that is checked out from version control.
There are several advantages to doing this. First, of course, is that the script is version-controlled. Second, we can edit the script with the editor or IDE of our choice before checking it in to version control. In addition, we can employ the same kind of "SCM Polling" that we would use in a more traditional Jenkins job.
In the following steps, we'll create a Jenkinsfile and create a pipeline job that uses it.

__1. Open the Eclipse editor.
If this lab is completed in the normal sequence, you should have the 'SimpleGreeting' project already in Eclipse's workspace. If not, check out the project from version control (consult your instructor for directions if necessary).
__2. In the Project Explorer, right-click on the root node of the SimpleGreeting project, and then select New → File.
__3. Enter Jenkinsfile as the file name.
![[Pasted image 20230226124930.png]]
__4. Click Finish to create the new file.
__5. You may see the 'Editors available on the Marketplace' window, just click Cancel.
__6. You may see a compatibility error, just click OK.
__7. Enter the following text into the new file (Note: this is the same script that we used above, so you could copy/paste it from the Jenkins Web UI if you want to avoid some typing):
```
node {
stage('Checkout') {
git url: 'C:\\Software\\repos\\SimpleGreeting.git'
}
stage('Gradle build') {
bat 'gradle build'
}
}
```
__8. Save the Jenkinsfile by selecting File → Save from the main menu, or by hitting Ctrl-S.
__9. In the Project Explorer, right-click on the SimpleGreeting node, and then select
Team → Commit...
__10. Eclipse will open the Git Staging tab. Right click Jenkinsfile and click Add to
Index.
![[Pasted image 20230226125000.png]]
__11. The file will be now available in the 'Staged Changed' section. Add a comment and click Commit and Push then click Close to dismiss the next window.
Now we have a Jenkinsfile in our project, to define the pipeline. Next, we need to create a Jenkins job to use that pipeline.
![[Pasted image 20230226125114.png]]
__12. In the Jenkins user interface, navigate to the root page, and then click on New Item.
__13. Enter SimpleGreetingPipelineFromGit as the name of the new item.
__14. Select Pipeline as the item type.
__15. Click OK to create the new item.
__16. Scroll down to the Build Triggers section.
__17. Click on Poll SCM
__18. Enter * * * * * as the polling schedule. This entry will cause Jenkins to poll once per minute.
__19. Scroll down to the Pipeline section, and change the Definition entry to
Pipeline Script from SCM.
__20. Enter the following:
SCM:Git
Repository URL:C:\Software\repos\SimpleGreeting.git
(Press the tab key)
The Pipeline section should look similar to:
__21. Click Save to save the new configuration.
__22. Click Build Now to launch the pipeline.
You should see the pipeline execute, similar to the previous section.
94Part 3 - Try out a Failing Build
The pipeline that we've defined so far appears to work perfectly. But we haven't tested it
with a build that fails. In the following steps, we'll insert a test failure and see what
happens to our pipeline.
__1. In Eclipse, go to the Project Explorer and locate the file Greeting.java. It will be
under src/main/java in the package com.simple.
__2. Open Greeting.java.
__3. Locate the line that reads 'return "GOOD";'. Change it to read 'return "BAD";'
__4. Save the file.
__5. In the Project Explorer, right-click on Greeting.java and then select Team →
Commit... (This is a shortcut for committing a single file).
__6. Enter an appropriate commit message and then click Commit and Push, then click
Close in the results box.
__7. Switch back to Jenkins.
__8. In a minute or so, you should see a build launched automatically. Jenkins has picked
up the change in the 'Git' repository and initiated a build. If nothing happens then click
Build Now.
This time, the results are a little different. The 'Gradle Build' stage is showing a failure.
95What's happened is that the unit tests have failed and Gradle exited with a non-zero result
code because of the failure. As a result, the rest of the pipeline was canceled. In case if
you want to perform a build without running unit tests, you can add -x test to gradle
build. This way Gradle will continue with the build even if the tests fail.
__9. Go back to Eclipse and open the 'Jenkinsfile' if necessary.
__10. Alter the 'bat "gradle" line to read as follows:
bat 'gradle build -x test'
__11. Save the 'Jenkinsfile'.
__12. Commit and push the changes using the same technique as above.
__13. After a minute or so, you should see a new Pipeline instance launched. If nothing
happens then click Build Now.
This time, the pipeline runs to completion.
Part 4 - Add a Manual Approval Step
One of the interesting features of the Pipeline functionality is that we can include manual
steps. This is very useful when we're implementing a continuous deployment pipeline.
For example, we can include a manual approval step (or any other data collection) for
cases like 'User Acceptance Testing' that might not be fully automated.
In the steps below, we'll add a manual step before a simulated deployment.
96__1. Go to Eclipse and open the Jenkinsfile if necessary.
__2. Add the following to the end of the file before the node block closing }:
stage('User Acceptance Test') {
def response= input message: 'Is this build good to go?',
parameters: [choice(choices: 'Yes\nNo',
description: '', name: 'Pass')]
if(response=="Yes") {
stage('Deploy') {
bat 'gradle build -x test'
}
}
}
This portion of the script creates a new stage called 'User Acceptance Test', then executes
an 'input' operation to gather input from the user. If the result is 'Yes', the script executes
a deploy operation. (In this case, we're repeating the 'gradle build' that we did previously.
Only because we don't actually have a deployment repository setup)
__3. Save and commit 'Jenkinsfile' as previously.
__4. After a minute or so, you should see a new Pipeline instance launched. If nothing
happens then click Build Now.
__5. When the pipeline executes, watch for a "paused" stage called User Acceptance
Test. Move your mouse over this step, you'll be able to select "Yes" or "No".
97Note. If the Build is taking too long is probably because SimpleGreeting is launching a
build every time you commit changes in eclipse and your server is hanging the request
in the SimpleGreetingPipelineFromGit project, you can delete the SimpleGreetings
project if this happen.
__6. Select Yes and click Proceed.
You should see the job run to completion.
__7. Click Build Now to run the pipeline again but this time select No on the User
Acceptance Test and then click Proceed.
You'll see that the pipeline exits early and doesn't run the 'deploy' stage.
98What's happened is that the final 'Deploy' stage was only executed when we indicated
that the 'User Acceptance Test' had passed.
__8. Close all.
Part 5 - Review
In this lab, we explored the Pipeline functionality in Jenkins. We built a simple pipeline
in the Jenkins web UI, and then used a 'Jenkinsfile' in the project. Lastly, we explored
how to gather user input, and then take different build actions based on that user input.
