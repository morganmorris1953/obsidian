Project Jenkins Tasks

Setup Jenkins in Project VM and run Jenkins
- Create a Jenkins job to build dataservice project

- Build a Jenkins CI pipeline for dataservice and test it
- Build a Jenkins CI pipeline for authservice and test it


1. Go to Project VM. 

Open a terminal, go to /home/wasadmin/myjenkins
Start Jenkins with different httpPort, say 9000

java -jar jenkins.war --httpPort=9000


2. Configure Jenkins to use the tools -- follow WA2893 Lab 09		
java
git
gradle

3. Create a Jenkins job to build dataservice project and test it - follow WA2893 Lab 10  

4. Create a Jenkins job to build authservice project and test it -- follow WA2893 Lab 10  

5. Build a CI pipeline for dataservice and test it  - follow WA2893 Lab 11

# Notes


![[Pasted image 20230227091545.png]]

to start a db, a program calls a batch or shell file
C:\\db-derby.....\\bin is where startNetworkServer batch file is located 

```
derbydatacreate.sql
connect 'jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/my-mcc-db;create=true;user=fox;password=foxy';
```
this creates a db with user as "fox" and password as "foxy" if it doesn't exist, or logs in if it does exist

### To Run db server
use terminal to navigate to bin folder where the sql file is located
type "title derby database server"
type "startNetworkServer"

OR

navigate to bin folder where "startNetworkServer" file is located
type "ij" followed by the directory and name of the sql file you want to start

### How Eclipse calls a db

Choose the driver template, then click on "JAR List" to make sure the correct driver is selected.  If the server is running, click on "Test Connection"
